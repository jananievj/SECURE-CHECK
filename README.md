# SECURE-CHECK
In this project, I worked on analyzing traffic stop data using Python, SQL, and Streamlit to build a comprehensive dashboard. I started by downloading the dataset in Excel format and reading it in Jupyter Notebook using the pandas library. During the initial data preprocessing, I identified missing values in the search_type column and handled them by filling nulls using the mode of similar entries grouped by country_name and driver_race. I also experimented with other methods such as forward fill, backward fill, mean, and replacing nulls with zero, ensuring that the dataset became complete and clean. After preprocessing, I created a MySQL database and table using mysql.connector and inserted all the rows from the cleaned dataset into the traffic_data table.
Next, I built a Streamlit application for interactive visualization and analytics. I imported essential libraries including pandas, mysql.connector, pymysql, plotly.express, matplotlib, and seaborn. I wrote helper functions get_data and fetch_data to connect to the MySQL database, execute queries, and fetch results as pandas DataFrames. I then structured the dashboard with multiple pages, including Introduction, Data Explorer, SQL Analytics, Traffic Log Prediction, Visual Trends, and Creator Info.
In the Data Explorer, users can view sample data and filter it by gender or violation dynamically using SQL queries. The SQL Analytics page allows users to select predefined queries categorized by Vehicle-Based, Demographic-Based, Time & Duration-Based, Violation-Based, Location-Based, and Complex Queries, showing insights like top vehicle numbers involved in drug-related stops, arrest rates by driver age, search rates by race and gender, and more.The Traffic Log page allows users to input new traffic stop details through a form and predicts the likely stop outcome and violation based on historical data, using modes of matching filtered records. For visualization, I implemented the Visual Trends page using line charts to show hourly, monthly, and yearly traffic stop trends, providing an intuitive understanding of traffic patterns over time.
